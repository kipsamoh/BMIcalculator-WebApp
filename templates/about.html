            <h2>What is BMI?</h2>
            <p>Body Mass Index (BMI) is a tool that estimates body fat by measuring the ratio of height to weight. It helps assess the risk for various health conditions. While useful, BMI is not always a precise indicator of body fat.</p>
            
            <h2>How is BMI Calculated?</h2>
            <p>BMI is calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by the square of height in meters (kg/m²). Generally, a higher BMI suggests more body fat, but it doesn’t always accurately represent body composition for everyone.</p>
            
            <h2>BMI Classifications:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Underweight: Less than 18.5</li>
                <li>Normal weight: 18.5 to 24.9</li>
                <li>Overweight: 25 to 29.9</li>
                <li>Obesity Class I: 30 to 34.9</li>
                <li>Obesity Class II: 35 to 39.9</li>
                <li>Obesity Class III: 40 and above</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Uses of BMI:</h2>
            <p>Healthcare providers use BMI to diagnose weight categories and as a screening tool for health risks. High body fat can lead to heart disease, diabetes, and other conditions, while low body fat may be associated with malnutrition and weakened immunity.</p>
            
            <h2>Limitations of BMI:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>BMI does not distinguish between muscle and fat.</li>
                <li>It uses the same chart for both males and females, despite differences in body fat distribution.</li>
                <li>BMI may not be accurate for athletes, children, the elderly, and pregnant individuals.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Health Risks Associated with BMI:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Underweight: Malnutrition, anemia, weakened immune system, osteoporosis.</li>
                <li>Overweight/Obesity: Heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, and mental health issues.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Calculation Example:</h2>
            <p>To calculate BMI:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Multiply your weight in pounds by 703.</li>
                <li>Divide by your height in inches twice.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>For instance, a person weighing 180 lbs and 5 feet 5 inches tall (65 inches) has a BMI of 29.9.</p>
            
            <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
            <p>While BMI is a useful tool for quick assessment, it should not be the sole measure of health. Consult healthcare providers for a comprehensive health evaluation.</p>
